# Adlister Project

This is the project that we will be going through in the latter part of the Java
curriculum.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository.

As we progress through the lessons, your instructors will push various git tags
corresponding to each lesson and exercise.

For each exercise you should:

1. checkout the corresponding tag

1. create a new branch for your work on the exercise

    **It is very important that you create and switch to a new branch here, if
    you do not, your work and commits could be lost!**

1. push up your branch

After each exercise is completed, a tag that provides the solution will be made
available to you so that you can check it out.
